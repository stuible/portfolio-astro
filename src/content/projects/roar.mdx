{/* # Background */}

{/* Within the ROAR project at Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH), I contributed as a developer by focusing on code refactoring and migrating it to Inertial.js. This initiative aimed to improve the scheduling and management of education sessions for newly hired employees at VCH. */}

# Role

In my role, I took on the responsibility of refactoring the codebase to enhance its structure, readability, and maintainability. Additionally, I spearheaded the migration to Inertial.js, which brought server-side rendering capabilities to the React front-end within the Laravel framework.

# Refactoring

Through code refactoring, I aimed to improve the overall quality of the project, making it more maintainable and extensible.

# Migration

The migration to Inertial.js allowed for faster page rendering and improved performance.

# Impact and Results

The code refactoring and migration efforts resulted in significant improvements to the performance and user experience of ROAR. The codebase became more robust and easier to work with, leading to increased development efficiency. By integrating Inertial.js, we reduced page load times and enhanced responsiveness, ultimately benefiting the scheduling and management of education sessions for newly hired employees at VCH.
