# Background

Emergency Department Wait Times is a website that helps patients find the right urgent care quickly. The website was originally built in 2012 and was in need of an update for the modern web.

# Discovery

During the initial discovery phase, we identified several issues with the existing website:

## Lack of CMS
Content changes required manual edits to static HTML files, increasing turn-around time and risk of errors during updates.

## Non-responsive design
The site performed poorly on mobile devices, where most users were likely accessing it during emergencies.

## Performance bottlenecks
The site load times were very slow at almost 10 seconds, leading to high bounce rates.

# Original Website

# Objectives

1. Modernize the user experience
2. Improve the performance of the website
3. Make it easier to maintain and update the website's content

# Process





# Results

## Faster load times
Page load time improved by 70%, ensuring that even during peak traffic, patients can access information quickly.

## Easier content management
Content administrators can now update content in minutes using the CMS, rather than needing developer intervention.

## Responsive design
The mobile-friendly interface now accounts for almost 80% of all traffic.
