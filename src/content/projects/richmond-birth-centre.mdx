# Background

In col­lab­o­ra­tion with Rich­mond Hos­pi­tal Birth Cen­tre and Vir­tu­al Health teams, this web­site pro­vides a cen­tral­ized por­tal for prospec­tive patients and their fam­i­lies to access essen­tial and rel­e­vant infor­ma­tion any­where, any­time. Users will find infor­ma­tion about the birthing cen­tre, includ­ing the ser­vices, and the team, as well as sup­port and resources avail­able through­out the preg­nan­cy jour­ney from antepar­tum to postpartum.
