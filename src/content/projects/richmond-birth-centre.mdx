tldr: Built for the Richmond Birth Centre, this web­site pro­vides a cen­tral­ized por­tal for prospec­tive patients and their fam­i­lies to access essen­tial and rel­e­vant infor­ma­tion. I implemented this CMS-backed website with a tag-based search using Craft CMS with a sprinkling of interactivity using Vue.js.

# Background

In col­lab­o­ra­tion with Rich­mond Hos­pi­tal Birth Cen­tre and Vir­tu­al Health teams, this web­site pro­vides a cen­tral­ized por­tal for prospec­tive patients and their fam­i­lies to access essen­tial and rel­e­vant infor­ma­tion any­where, any­time. Users will find infor­ma­tion about the birthing cen­tre, includ­ing the ser­vices, and the team, as well as sup­port and resources avail­able through­out the preg­nan­cy jour­ney from antepar­tum to postpartum.

# Role

Alongside an instructional designer and user-interface designer, I worked to implement the provided mockups.

{/* # Challenges */}

{/* Prior to our triage tool, new patients faced challenges in identifying the most suitable clinic within the Vancouver Coastal Health network. The existing system lacked a dynamic approach to geolocating patients, resulting in inefficient triage and potential delays in accessing critical care. Our objective was to develop an application that leveraged geolocation technology to guide patients to the appropriate clinic swiftly and effectively. */}
