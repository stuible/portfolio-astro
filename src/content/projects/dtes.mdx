# Background

Nurses that work on and around the Downtown Eastside (DTES) are typically taken on a tour to familairize themsleves with the people and places that they will be working with. Due to concerns around COVID-19, and to make the tour more accessible to VCH staff members, our team was brought in to design and implemnt a virtual tour that would mirror this experience.

It provides a virtual tour of some of the community-based services in the DTES, Richmond, and Coastal communities within the Vancouver Coastal Health region, and shares video interviews with community members who have been impacted by stigma. The objective of the course is to allow healthcare providers to better understand the lives of their clients, to provide culturally safe practice, to increase access to care, and improve quality of care for people who use substances.

# Goals

People who use substances living on the DTES are often stigmatized and labelled with negative stereotypes, including within the healthcare system. The goal of the project is to help decrease stigma in healthcare, enhance providers’ understanding of the community and build healthcare providers’ skills and confidence working with clients who use substances.
