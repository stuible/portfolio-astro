subtitle: How I created a customized onboarding experience for Community Healthcare Workers
tldr: This website was developed to provide per­son­al­ized ori­en­ta­tion time­lines for all new hires. A unique link is gen­er­at­ed for each user to help keep track of all required actions, sta­tus and due dates. This aims to guide the ori­en­ta­tion expe­ri­ence and to sup­port the com­ple­tion of onboard­ing actions on time.
