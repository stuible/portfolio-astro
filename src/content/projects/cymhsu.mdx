# Background

As a part of Vancouver Coastal Health's Child & Youth Mental Health & Substance Use strategy, the decision was made to offer Digital intake for new patients.  
A digital intake form is an electronic version of a questionnaire or survey that collects patient information prior to their visit to a mental health clinic. It allows the clinic to efficiently gather essential details about the patient's medical history, symptoms, and goals, streamlining the intake process and improving data accuracy.

During a recent push to digitize the intake process for new mental health clinic patients.

I was tasked with the development and implemention of a geolocation-based triage tool that efficiently directed new patients to the appropriate clinics. By leveraging the power of Vue.js, TypeScript, and the Mapbox API, I successfully created a user-friendly and intuitive solution that streamlined the triage process and improved patient access to vital healthcare services.


# Background

# Role

# Challenges

Prior to our triage tool, new patients faced challenges in identifying the most suitable clinic within the Vancouver Coastal Health network. The existing system lacked a dynamic approach to geolocating patients, resulting in inefficient triage and potential delays in accessing critical care. Our objective was to develop an application that leveraged geolocation technology to guide patients to the appropriate clinic swiftly and effectively.
